# Intro
- In real research, population parameters (e.g., $\mu$, $\sigma$) are usually unknown.
- We use **random samples** to estimate them:
  - $\mu \rightarrow \bar{x}$ (sample mean)
  - $\sigma \rightarrow s$ (sample standard deviation)
- These estimates are valid **only under random sampling**.
- No assumption of normality is needed for this substitution.
- For small samples, normality may matter for inference — **not for estimation**.

# The mean 


$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
$$

Where:  
- $\bar{x}$ is the mean  
- $x_i$ represents each individual observation  
- $n$ is the total number of observations

# the sample mean

The sample mean $\bar{x}$ is used as an estimator for the population mean $\mu$:
$$
\hat{\mu} = \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
$$

where:
- $\hat{\mu}$ is the estimated population mean,
- $x_i$ are the individual sample observations,
- $n$ is the sample size.

# Median

---

The **median** is the middle value of an ordered dataset:

$$
\text{Median}(x) =
\begin{cases}
x_{\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)} & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\\\
\frac{1}{2} \left( x_{\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)} + x_{\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)} \right) & \text{if } n \text{ is even}
\end{cases}
$$

- $x_{(i)}$ is the $i$-th smallest value (i.e., ordered statistics)  
- $n$ is the number of observations

# Quantile 
## Definition of a Quantile

- A **quantile** specifies the value below which a given proportion of observations fall.
- The **\( p \)-th quantile** \( q_p \) satisfies:

$$
P(X \leq q_p) = p
$$

---

## Mathematical Expression

- Using the cumulative distribution function \( F(x) \), the quantile can be expressed as:

$$
q_p = \inf \{ x : F(x) \geq p \}
$$

- Where:
  - \( F(x) \) is the CDF of the random variable \( X \),
  - \( \inf \) denotes the infimum (greatest lower bound).

---

## Key Examples

- **Median**: 50th percentile, \( p = 0.5 \), \( q_{0.5} \)
- **First Quartile (Q1)**: 25th percentile, \( p = 0.25 \), \( q_{0.25} \)
- **Third Quartile (Q3)**: 75th percentile, \( p = 0.75 \), \( q_{0.75} \)

## Visual Representation (Optional)

*(You can add a plot showing a CDF curve and marking quantiles, if needed.)*

# Dispersion

- Dispersion describes how spread out data are around the central value  
- Key measures:  
  - **Variance**  
  - **Standard Deviation**  
  - **Standard Error of the Mean**
  
# Variance 

- Measures the **average squared deviation** from the mean  
- Captures how data values spread out from the centre  
- Formula:  
  $$
  s^2 = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2
  $$
- Units are in **squared** scale of the original variable  
- Sensitive to **outliers**

# Variance properties

- Always **non-negative**  
- Zero variance means **all values are identical**  
- Units are **not intuitive** (squared units)  
- Forms the basis for standard deviation and many inferential statistics


# Variance and standard deviation: Population
$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2
$$
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}
$$

# Standard Deviation (Sample)

- Square root of the variance  
- Expresses dispersion in **original units**  
- Formula:  
  $$
  s = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 }
  $$
- Most commonly used measure of spread  
- Like variance, sensitive to **extreme values**

# Properties of Standard Deviation (Sample)

- Easy to interpret — same units as the data  
- Used in constructing **confidence intervals** and **hypothesis tests**  
- When $s$ is large: data are more spread out  
- When $s$ is small: data cluster near the mean

# Variance and standard deviation: Sample 
$$
s^2 = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$
$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$


# Standard Error of the Sample Mean (SEM)

- Measures the **precision** of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean  
- Formula:  
  $$
  \text{SE}_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$
- Decreases with **larger sample size**  
- Used in confidence intervals and tests for means


# standard error of the mean 

$$
SE_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$
